# ShoppingQ
ShoppingQ is an online tool designed to bring back the fluidity of your nomal life by minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on your shopping experience. It serves as a platform where business owners can instantaneously publish information regarding the amount of people visiting their stores, for the safety, wellbeing and enjoyment of everyone.
This github is a early prototype of the final product which we imagined. In order to run the prototype and simulate the experience, several steps needs to be taken to simulate a server environment on a personal computer:

1. Install Xampp, which is one of the most popular methods of hosting local servers on one's computer to run PHP code and utilize databases.

2. After installing Xampp, copy and replace the htdocs folder and mysql folder under the directory which xampp is installed with the files that we have provided in the github repository. We have set up the data base and coded the website for you to enjoy!

3. Open up Xampp control panel to run Apache and mysql, and type in "localhost" on the navigation bar of your browser of choice.

4. On the web application click on Administrator to sign up, add address values for the company, and provide line_lengths.

5. On the client side, by providing the address of the store the application returns the average wait time.
