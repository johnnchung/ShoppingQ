READ BEFORE EDITING CODE PLS

copy and paste all of the stuff into htdocs if you r using xampp and then you will be able to run in in ur browser by typing in the address "localhost"

this is the barebones and we can split into different branches from now on. pls use <?php include ?> where ever you can so u make the least amount of edits onto the index.php file. This decrease error when mergin in future.
